        <h2>
            What is now the National Gallery Singapore used to be two national monuments: the former Supreme Court and City Hall. Located in the heart of the civic district, both buildings have borne witness to several of Singapore’s historical milestones. First constructed in the 1920s and 30s, both the former Supreme Court and City Hall are now home to Singapore’s largest museum, housing a vast collection of artwork within its historically rich halls.
