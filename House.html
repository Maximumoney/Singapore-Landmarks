        <h2>
            Now known as The Arts House, the Old Parliament House is probably the oldest surviving colonial structure in Singapore. In 1826, the original building was designed and built by architect G.D. Coleman as a neo-Palladian residence. The former Parliament House was gazetted as a national monument in 1992 and in 2003, was converted to The Arts Houseâ€”which has been a polestar for the Arts in Singapore since.
