        <h2>
            Originally named after its neighbouring Esplanade Park, one of the oldest public parks in Singapore, the iconic 60,000-square-metre Performing Arts centre is affectionately dubbed ‘The Durian’ by locals due to its spiky architectural exterior. Having been in the works since the 1970s, the Esplanade was set up as a hub where Singaporeans can engage with and be inspired by the local arts and culture scene.
            <br>
            Since opening its doors in 2002, the Esplanade has revolutionised the Arts in Singapore and grown into a bustling hub for shopping, dining and entertainment. The venue showcases a range of performances all year round, from free shows held by the bay, to yearly festivals such as Baybeats, da:ns festival, Huayi – Chinese Festival of Arts, and many more.
