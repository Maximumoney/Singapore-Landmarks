        <h2>
            Catch a glimpse of Singapore’s most majestic icon, the Merlion, a mythical creature that’s half-fish and half-lion. The Merlion combines two elements of Singapore’s identity—its body symbolises the fishing villages of Singapore’s past, while its lion head is a symbol of Singapura (“lion city” in Sanskrit).
            <br>
            The Merlion, built by local craftsman Lim Nang Seng, was unveiled on 15 September 1972 by then-Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew. The icon was originally positioned at the mouth of the Singapore River, but was later moved to its current spot overlooking the bay at the Merlion Park.
