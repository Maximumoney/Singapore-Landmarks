        <h2>
            Now home to an array of shops, bars and restaurants, CHIJMES used to be a Catholic convent school way back in the 1800s. The compound houses several buildings of varying architectural styles and set up during different points in history, such as an orphanage, a dormitory and a Gothic Chapel.

            The complex was renamed CHIJMES in 1990, a reference to the conventâ€™s acronym and the sound of its tower bells. After redevelopment work, CHIJMES has grown into the well-loved dining and nightlife enclave that it is today.
